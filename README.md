# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

To avoid the curse of dimensionality and avoid overfitting particularly when we have a lot of features and relatively few samples one of the 
most common approach is that of reducing dimensionality in feature space. Reduction of dimensionality is the method of reducing 
the dimensionality of the function space by obtaining a collection of principal features.
